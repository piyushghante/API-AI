  "message": "<user_message>"
}
```

### Headers:

```http
Content-Type: application/json
```

## ‚úÖ Examples

### 1. Start a conversation

```bash
curl -X POST https://api-ai-flst.onrender.com/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "session_id": "demo123",
    "message": "Hi, my name is Piyush"
  }'
```

### 2. Provide appointment date and time

```bash
curl -X POST https://api-ai-flst.onrender.com/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "session_id": "demo123",
    "message": "Appointment on 22 July at 4:30 PM"
  }'
```

### 3. Provide purpose

```bash
curl -X POST https://api-ai-flst.onrender.com/chat \

## üß† Booking Simulation

Once all required fields are collected:

* Name
* Date/Time
* Purpose

The assistant automatically sends a POST request to:

```
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
```

You‚Äôll receive a response like:

```json
{
  "reply": "‚úÖ Appointment booked successfully for Piyush on 22 July at 4:30 PM for consultation.",
  "done": true
}
```

## üìù Notes

* Always reuse the same `session_id` to maintain context.
* The API is designed for demonstration purposes.
* Gemini is used via Google Generative AI's Python SDK.
